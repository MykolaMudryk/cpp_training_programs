Console Calculator (OOP)
This program is a simple calculator implemented in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) style. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Main Features:
Input of two numbers.
Selection of one arithmetic operation: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), or division (/).
Displays the result of the operation.
Handles errors such as division by zero.
OOP Structure:
The program follows an OOP approach to implement the calculator's functionality:

SetOperands: A class for setting and retrieving the numbers (operands).
SetOperation: A class for inputting the arithmetic operation.
ExecuteOperations: A class responsible for performing the arithmetic operations based on the provided inputs.
Each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) is implemented as a separate class (e.g., Addition, Subtraction), adhering to the principles of encapsulation and modularity.

Other Implementations:
Procedural Calculator: A version of the program where the calculator is implemented in a procedural style, without using classes.

GUI Calculator: A graphical interface version of the calculator, implemented using the Qt library for better user interaction.
